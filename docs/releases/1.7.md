# Jetstream v1.7 Release Notes

# Major changes

- A large number of backends have been added supporting docker, singularity, and dnanexus.

- Slurm backend(s) settings have been moved to the overall settings config. Allows for user level slurm backend adjustments. For example, 
"NODE_FAIL" is now considered as an active state since the job should be requeued and potentially completed by slurm.


# Bug Fixes

- A deprecation level bug was introduced in python 3.10 relating to certain asyncio functions. We currently support python 3.7+.

- Version checking has been updated to use packaging.version instead of distutils.version to be inline with PEP 440.


# Dev notes

- Updated unit test for container based backends

- Version checking has been updated to use packaging.version instead of distutils.version to be inline with PEP 440.
