# Jetstream v1.7.2 Release Notes

## Major changes

- This adds the LibYAML implementation of yaml parsing if available, otherwise it defaults to the PyYAML implementation - more details available in issue #143
- Handling an issue from a downstream pipeline - [#10](https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/10)
  - By using the identity of the task for the slurm_singularity backend generated files, we avoid the potential for a sample.name or any user supplied variable generating a task name that is longer than 255 characters.
- Better containerization of the slurm_singularity backend, using `--contain` ensures that we don't bind /home or any other directories defined in the singularity.conf unless we explicitly bind them
  - We also only use `--nv` if CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is defined, some users have been misled into thinking that the warning thrown when on a non-gpu box is a job breaking error.

## Minor changes

- Updated mash report text - #116
