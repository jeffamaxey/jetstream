# Jetstream v1.7.3 Release Notes

## Major changes
- For slurm backends, the `sacct` pinginess has been reduced, and we request less information install of `--all`, this reduces load on the slurmdbd
- The slurm_singularity backend can now submit jobs without a container definition
- Added an `md5` and `assignbin` filter for using in templates
  - Resolves https://github.com/tgen/jetstream/issues/101

## Bug fixes
- Not all asyncio.Event(loop)'s were fixed in previous commits, this should fix other cases impeding us from using python 3.10 https://github.com/tgen/jetstream/issues/144

## Minor changes
- Adjusted handling of gpu jobs for the `slurm_singularity` backend, we now set `SINGULARITYENV_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`

## Ease of use updates
- A bash completion script is available under `extras/completions/jetstream.bash`, this is still in development, but can be used as a template for other users. This can be installed under `~/.bash_completion` or to your preferred user completion script dir, e.g. `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/jetstream.bash`
