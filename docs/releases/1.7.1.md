# Jetstream v1.7.1 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

- We ran into a case where we were pinging the container registry way too frequently and getting IO timeouts. Now scripts generated by the slurm_singularity backend will have more extensive bash logic in order to use the cached singularity image if available, it should always be available unless the cache location is cleaned up post starting jetstream. This drastically reduces the "pinginess".

## Minor changes

- Reduced complexity of slurm_singularity makedirs the creation of output directories.

## Dev notes

- Updated maintainer info in `__init__.py`
